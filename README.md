# Recipe Manager

Recipe Manager is a web application that enables users to effortlessly add, edit, and delete recipes. It features a user-friendly form for entering recipe details such as title, ingredients, and instructions. The recipes are presented in an appealing layout, offering interactive options for deleting or editing each one.

This project was crafted with the aim of enhancing my skills in TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and React Router.
